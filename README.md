⏱️ Stopwatch Project

The Stopwatch Project is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that accurately measures elapsed time. This project demonstrates the practical use of JavaScript timing functions and DOM manipulation to create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch interface.

The application allows users to start, pause, resume, and reset the stopwatch with precise control. Time is displayed in a clear and readable format including hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, making it suitable for tracking short or long durations.

The stopwatch works by using JavaScript’s setInterval() function to update the time at fixed intervals. The logic ensures accurate time calculation even when the stopwatch is paused and resumed, preventing time mismatch or duplication. Event listeners are used to handle button actions such as start, stop, and reset, ensuring smooth user interaction.

A clean and responsive user interface is designed using CSS, allowing the application to function properly on different screen sizes such as desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. The layout focuses on simplicity and usability so that users can easily operate the stopwatch without confusion.

This project is ideal for beginners who want to understand JavaScript timers, event handling, and real-time UI updates. It can be further enhanced by adding features such as lap recording, theme switching (dark/light mode), sound alerts, or keyboard shortcuts.

Overall, the Stopwatch Project serves as a strong foundation for learning frontend development concepts and showcases the ability to build functional, interactive web applications using core web technologies.
